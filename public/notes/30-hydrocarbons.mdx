30\.1 Arenes:

1. Chemistry of Arenes:
   1. Arenes are aromatic hydrocarbons that contain a benzene ring (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) or other aromatic rings. Benzene and methylbenzene (toluene) are commonly used as examples.
1. Substitution Reactions of Benzene and Methylbenzene: 

(a) Halogenation: Benzene and methylbenzene undergo substitution reactions with halogens (Cl<sub>2</sub> and Br<sub>2</sub>) in the presence of a catalyst such as AlCl<sub>3</sub> or AlBr<sub>3</sub> to form halogenoarenes (aryl halides).

(b) Nitration: Benzene and methylbenzene react with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) at a temperature between 25°C and 60°C to undergo nitration, resulting in the introduction of a nitro group (-NO<sub>2</sub>).

(c) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation: Benzene and methylbenzene can undergo alkylation reactions using alkyl halides (e.g., CH<sub>3</sub>Cl) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst such as AlCl<sub>3</sub> and heat. This leads to the addition of an alkyl group (-R) to the benzene ring. 

(d) Friedel-Crafts Acylation: Benzene and methylbenzene can undergo acylation reactions using acyl chlorides (e.g., CH<sub>3</sub>COCl) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst such as AlCl<sub>3</sub> and heat. This results in the addition of an acyl group (-COR) to the benzene ring. 

(e) Side-Chain Oxidation: The side chain of methylbenzene can be completely oxidized using hot alkaline potassium permanganate (KMnO<sub>4</sub>) followed by dilute acid, leading to the formation of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the benzene ring. 

(f) Hydrogenation: The benzene ring of benzene or methylbenzene can be hydrogenated using hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) and a catalyst such as platinum (Pt) or nickel (Ni) at high temperature, resulting in the formation of a cyclohexane ring.

1. Mechanism of Electrophilic Substitution in Arenes:
   1. Electrophilic substitution is the main type of reaction in arenes.
   1. The mechanism involves the formation of a reactive electrophile and the attack of the electrophile on the electron-rich benzene ring.
   1. The delocalization (aromatic stabilization) of electrons in the benzene ring makes it highly stable, resulting in a predominance of substitution reactions over addition reactions.
1. Side-Chain vs. Aromatic Ring Halogenation:
   1. The position of halogenation (substitution) in arenes depends on reaction conditions.
   1. Under normal conditions, halogenation occurs in the aromatic ring, resulting in the substitution of a hydrogen atom.
   1. However, under specific reaction conditions, such as using a strong electrophile or high temperature, halogenation can occur in the side chain of the arene.
