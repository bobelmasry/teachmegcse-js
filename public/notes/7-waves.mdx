## 7.1 Progressive waves:
 ### 7.1.1 Wave motion:

- Wave motion is the transfer of energy through a medium without the physical transfer of matter. Examples include vibrations in ropes, springs, and ripple tanks.

### 7.1.2 Terms related to waves:

- Displacement: The distance and direction of a point on a wave from its equilibrium position.
- Amplitude: The maximum displacement of a wave from its equilibrium position.
- Phase difference: The difference in phase between two points on a wave.
- Period: The time taken for one complete oscillation or cycle of a wave.
- Frequency: The number of complete oscillations or cycles of a wave per unit time.
- Wavelength: The distance between two consecutive points in phase on a wave.
- Speed: The rate at which a wave propagates through a medium.
- The wave equation: **v = fλ**, where v is the wave speed, f is the frequency, and λ is the wavelength.

### 7.1.3 Energy and intensity of progressive waves:

- Energy is transferred by a progressive wave as it propagates through a medium.
- Intensity is the power per unit area carried by a wave and is given by intensity = power/area.
- Intensity is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the wave (intensity ∝ amplitude<sup>2</sup>).

## 7.2 Transverse and longitudinal waves:

- Transverse waves: The displacement of the medium is perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation.
- Longitudinal waves: The displacement of the medium is parallel to the direction of wave propagation.

## 7.3 Doppler effect for sound waves:

- The Doppler effect describes the change in frequency observed when a source of sound waves moves relative to a stationary observer.
- The observed frequency (f<sub>o</sub>) is given by **f<sub>o</sub> = f<sub>s</sub>(v / (v ± v<sub>s</sub>))**, where fs is the source frequency, v is the speed of sound, and vs is the speed of the source relative to the observer.

## 7.4 Electromagnetic spectrum:

- The electromagnetic spectrum includes all electromagnetic waves, which are transverse waves that travel at the speed of light "c" in free space.
- The spectrum ranges from radio waves (long wavelength, low frequency) to gamma rays (short wavelength, high frequency).
- Visible light falls within the wavelength range of approximately 400-700nm.

## 7.5 Polarisation:

- Polarisation is a phenomenon associated with transverse waves.
- Malus's law (I = I<sub>0</sub> cos<sup>2</sup> θ) describes the intensity of a plane-polarised electromagnetic wave after transmission through one or more polarising filters, where I<sub>0</sub> is the initial intensity and θ is the angle between the transmission axis of the filter(s) and the direction of polarisation.
