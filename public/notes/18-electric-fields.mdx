## 18.1 Electric Fields and Field Lines

### Electric Field:
>**force per unit positive charge**

- An electric field is a field of force that surrounds any charged object or group of charged objects.

- The force on a charge in an electric field is given by **F = qE**, where F is the force, q is the charge, and E is the electric field strength.

- Electric fields can be represented by field lines. Field lines point in the direction of the electric field, and the density of the lines represents the strength of the field.

## 18.2 Uniform Electric Fields

- A uniform electric field is a constant electric field between two parallel plates. The field strength of a uniform electric field is given by **E = ∆V/∆d**, where E is the electric field strength, ∆V is the potential difference between the plates, and ∆d is the distance between the plates.

- A uniform electric field can affect the motion of charged particles. Charged particles in a uniform electric field will experience a force and move in the direction of the electric field if the particle is positively charged, or in the opposite direction if the particle is negatively charged.

## 18.3 Electric Force Between Point Charges

- For a point outside a spherical conductor, the charge on the sphere can be considered to be a point charge at its center.

- Coulomb's law states that the force (F) between two point charges (Q1 and Q2) in free space is given by **F = kQ<sub>1</sub>Q<sub>2</sub>/r<sup>2</sup>**, where k is Coulomb's constant, and r is the distance between the charges.

## 18.4 Electric Field of a Point Charge

- The electric field strength (E) due to a point charge in free space is given by **E = kQ/r<sup>2</sup>**, where Q is the charge of the point charge, and r is the distance from the point charge.

## 18.5 Electric Potential
### Electric Potential:

> **work done per unit positive charge in bringing a small test charge from infinity to the point.**

- The electric field at a point is equal to the negative of the potential gradient at that point.

- The electric potential (V) in the field due to a point charge is given by **V = kQ/r**, where Q is the charge of the point charge, and r is the distance from the point charge.

- The electric potential energy (U) of two point charges is given by **U = kQ<sub>1</sub>Q<sub>2</sub>/r**, where Q<sub>1</sub> and Q<sub>2</sub> are the charges of the two point charges, and r is the distance between them.
