## 22.1 Energy and Momentum of a Photon

- **Electromagnetic Radiation**: Electromagnetic radiation has both wave-like and particle-like properties.

- **Photon**: A photon is a quantum of electromagnetic energy that behaves as a particle.

- **Energy of a Photon**: The energy of a photon is given by **E = hf**, where h is Planck's constant and f is the frequency of the radiation.

- **Electronvolt (eV)**: The electronvolt is a common unit of energy for particles, with 1 eV equivalent to 1.6 x 10^-19 J.

- **Photon Momentum**: A photon has momentum, which is given by **p = E/c**, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum.

## 22.2 Photoelectric Effect

- **Emission of Photoelectrons**: Photoelectrons can be emitted from a metal surface when it is illuminated by electromagnetic radiation.

- **Threshold Frequency/Wavelength**: The minimum frequency or wavelength of radiation required to emit photoelectrons from a metal surface is called the threshold frequency or threshold wavelength, respectively.

- **Work Function**: The energy required to remove an electron from a metal surface is called the work function, denoted by Φ.

- **Maximum Kinetic Energy**: The maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons emitted from a metal surface is given by the equation **hf = Φ + 1/2mv<sup>2</sup>**, where m is the mass of the electron and v is its velocity.

- **Intensity and Photoelectric Current**: The maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons is independent of the intensity of the incident radiation, but the number of photoelectrons emitted (i.e., the photoelectric current) is proportional to the intensity.

## 22.3 Wave-Particle Duality

- **Wave-Particle Behavior**: The photoelectric effect suggests that electromagnetic radiation behaves as particles, while phenomena such as interference and diffraction suggest that it behaves as waves.

- **Electron Diffraction**: Electron diffraction experiments demonstrate the wave-like nature of particles, where electrons exhibit diffraction patterns when passed through a diffraction grating.

- **de Broglie Wavelength**: The de Broglie wavelength is the wavelength associated with a moving particle, given by **λ = h/p**, where p is the momentum of the particle.

- **Wave-Particle Duality**: The wave-particle duality suggests that particles, including photons and electrons, exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior.

## 22.4 Energy Levels in Atoms and Line Spectra

- **Discrete Energy Levels**: Electrons in atoms occupy discrete energy levels, and transitions between energy levels result in the absorption or emission of radiation.

- **Line Spectra**: The appearance and formation of emission and absorption line spectra can be explained by transitions between energy levels in atoms.

- **Energy of Transitions**: The energy of a photon emitted or absorbed during a transition between energy levels is given by **hf = E<sub>1</sub> - E<sub>2</sub>**, where E<sub>1</sub> and E<sub>2</sub> are the initial and final energy levels of the electron.
