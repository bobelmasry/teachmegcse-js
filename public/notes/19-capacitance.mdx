## 19.1 Capacitors and Capacitance
### Capacitance :
>**The charge stored per unit potential difference, i.e., C = Q/V**

- Capacitors in series have a combined capacitance given by 1/C = 1/C1 + 1/C2 + 1/C3 + ..., while capacitors in parallel have a combined capacitance given by C = C1 + C2 + C3 + ....

## 19.2 Energy Stored in a Capacitor

- The electric potential energy stored in a capacitor is given by **U = (1/2)CV<sup>2</sup>** or **U = (1/2)QV**, where C is the capacitance, V is the potential difference, and Q is the charge on the capacitor.

## 19.3 Discharging a Capacitor

- When a capacitor discharges through a resistor, the potential difference, charge, and current vary with time.

- The time constant **τ = RC**, where R is the resistance of the resistor and C is the capacitance of the capacitor.

- The charge, current, and potential difference for a discharging capacitor can be modeled using equations of the form **x = x<sub>0</sub> e<sup>(-t/RC)</sup>**, where x represents current, charge, or potential difference.
