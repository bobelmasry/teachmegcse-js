Revision Notes - Deformation of Solids

6. Deformation of Solids:

6\.1 Stress and strain: 6.1.1 Deformation:

- Deformation occurs when solids experience tensile (stretching) or compressive (squeezing) forces in one dimension.

6\.1.2 Terms related to deformation:

- Load: The force applied to a solid.
- Extension: The increase in length of a solid when subjected to a tensile force.
- Compression: The decrease in length of a solid when subjected to a compressive force.
- Limit of proportionality: The maximum stress at which Hooke's law is valid, beyond which the material exhibits non-linear behavior.

6\.1.3 Hooke's law:

- Hooke's law states that the extension of a spring or elastic material is directly proportional to the applied force, as long as the elastic limit is not exceeded.
- Mathematically, F = kx, where F is the applied force, x is the extension, and k is the spring constant.

6\.1.4 Young modulus:

- The Young modulus (Y) is a measure of the stiffness of a material and is defined as the ratio of stress to strain.
- Young modulus (Y) = stress / strain.

6\.1.5 Determining the Young modulus:

- An experiment can be conducted to determine the Young modulus of a metal wire. This typically involves measuring the extension of the wire under different loads and calculating the stress and strain values.

6\.2 Elastic and plastic behavior: 6.2.1 Elastic deformation:

- Elastic deformation occurs when a material returns to its original shape after the applied force is removed.

6\.2.2 Plastic deformation:

- Plastic deformation occurs when a material undergoes permanent deformation and does not return to its original shape after the applied force is removed.

6\.2.3 Force-extension graph and work done:

- The area under a force-extension graph represents the work done on the material during deformation.

6\.2.4 Elastic potential energy:

- For a material deformed within its limit of proportionality, the elastic potential energy (EP) can be calculated using EP = 1/2 Fx = 1/2 kx^2, where F is the applied force, x is the extension, and k is the spring constant.
