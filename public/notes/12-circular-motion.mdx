## 12.1 Kinematics of Uniform Circular Motion

### Radian:
> **angle subtended at the center of a circle by an arc equal in length to the radius of the circle**
### Angular displacement: 
> **angle moved by an object in circular motion, expressed in radians**
### Angular Speed:
ensp **rate of change of angular displacement. It is defined as the angle moved per unit time, usually measured in radians per second (rad/s) or ω** &ensp;

- The relationship between angular speed and the period of the motion is given by **ω = 2π/T**, where T is the period of the motion.

- The linear speed of an object in circular motion is given by **v = rω**, where v is the linear speed, r is the radius of the circle, and ω is the angular speed.

## 12.2 Centripetal Acceleration

- Centripetal acceleration is the acceleration of an object moving in a circle due to a force acting towards the center of the circle. It is always perpendicular to the direction of motion of the object.

- Centripetal acceleration causes circular motion with a constant angular speed.

- The magnitude of the centripetal acceleration is given by **a = rω<sup>2</sup>**, where a is the centripetal acceleration, r is the radius of the circle, and ω is the angular speed.

- The magnitude of the centripetal acceleration can also be expressed in terms of linear speed as **a = v<sup>2</sup>/r**, where v is the linear speed.

- The centripetal force for an object in circular motion is given by **F = ma = mrω<sup>2</sup> or 
 F = mv<sup>2</sup>/r**, where F is the centripetal force, m is the mass of the object, r is the radius of the circle, ω is the angular speed, and v is the linear speed.
