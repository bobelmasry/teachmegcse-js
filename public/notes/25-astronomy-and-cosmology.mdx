## 25.1 Standard Candles

- **Luminosity**: Luminosity is the total power of radiation emitted by a star.

- **Inverse Square Law**: The inverse square law for radiant flux intensity F in terms of the luminosity L of the source is **F = L /(4πd²)**.

- **Standard Candle**: An object of known luminosity is called a standard candle.

- **Distance Determination**: Standard candles are used to determine distances to galaxies.

## 25.2 Stellar Radii

- **Wien’s Displacement Law**: Wien’s displacement law λ max ∝ 1 / T is used to estimate the peak surface temperature of a star.

- **Stefan–Boltzmann Law**: The Stefan–Boltzmann law **L = 4πσr²T⁴** is used to estimate the radius of a star.

## 25.3 Hubble’s Law and the Big Bang Theory

- **Emission Spectra**: The lines in the emission spectra from distant objects show an increase in wavelength from their known values.

- **Redshift Formula**: The redshift of electromagnetic radiation from a source moving relative to an observer is given by **∆λ / λ** . **∆f/f** . **v / c**.

- **Expansion of the Universe**: Redshift leads to the idea that the Universe is expanding.

- **Hubble’s Law**: Hubble’s law **v = H<sub>0</sub>d** is used to explain how the Universe is expanding and to support the Big Bang theory.
