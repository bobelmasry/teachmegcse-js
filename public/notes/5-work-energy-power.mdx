## 5.1 Energy conservation:
 ### 5.1.1 Work:

- Work is done when a force acts on an object and causes it to move in the direction of the force.
- **Work done = force × displacement** in the direction of the force.

### 5.1.2 Conservation of energy:

- The principle of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed but can only be transferred or transformed from one form to another.
- The total energy of a closed system remains constant.

### 5.1.3 Efficiency:

- Efficiency is the ratio of useful energy output to the total energy input in a system.
- **Efficiency = (useful energy output / total energy input) × 100%**.

### 5.1.4 Power:

- Power is the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred.
- Power = work done / time taken.
- Power is also given by the formula **P = Fv**, where P is power, F is the force applied, and v is the velocity of the object.

## 5.2 Gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy:
 ### 5.2.1 Gravitational potential energy:

- Gravitational potential energy (EP) is the energy possessed by an object due to its position in a gravitational field.
- The change in gravitational potential energy (∆EP) is given by 
 **∆E<sub>P</sub> = mg∆h**, where m is the mass of the object, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and ∆h is the change in height.

### 5.2.2 Kinetic energy:

- Kinetic energy (EK) is the energy possessed by an object due to its motion.
- The formula for kinetic energy is **E<sub>K</sub> = 1/2mv<sup>2</sup>**, where m is the mass of the object and v is its velocity.
