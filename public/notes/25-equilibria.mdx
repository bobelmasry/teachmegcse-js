25\.1 Acids and Bases

1. Conjugate Acid and Conjugate Base:
   1. A conjugate acid is formed when a base gains a proton (H<sup>+</sup>).
   1. A conjugate base is formed when an acid loses a proton (H<sup>+</sup>).
1. Conjugate Acid-Base Pairs: 

Conjugate acid-base pairs are two species related by the gain or loss of a single proton. In a reaction, when an acid donates a proton, it forms its conjugate base, and when a base accepts a proton, it forms its conjugate acid.

1. pH, K<sub>a</sub>, pK<sub>a</sub>, and K<sub>w</sub>:
   1. pH: pH is a measure of the hydrogen ion concentration in a solution and is defined as the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration: 

`     `pH = -log [H<sup>+</sup>]

1. K<sub>a</sub>: K<sub>a</sub> is the acid dissociation constant, which represents the strength of an acid in a solution. It is the ratio of the concentration of the products (conjugate base and H<sup>+</sup>) to the concentration of the acid.

`    `K<sub>a</sub>=[H<sup>+</sup>][A<sup>-</sup>]/[HA]

where H<sup>+</sup> is the concentration of hydrogen ions, A<sup>-</sup> is concentration of the conjugate base of the acid, and HA is the concentration of chemical species HA.

1. pK<sub>a</sub>: pK<sub>a</sub> is the negative logarithm of Ka and is used to compare the acid strength of different compounds.

`      `pK<sub>a</sub> = -log K<sub>a</sub>

1. Kw: Kw is the ionic product of water. It is the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of water at 298 K. Its value is 1.00 x 10<sup>-14</sup> mol<sup>2</sup>dm<sup>-6</sup>.

K<sub>w</sub>=[H<sup>+</sup>][OH<sup>-</sup>]

Where [H+] is the concentration of hydrogen ions, and [OH<sup>-</sup>] is the concentration of hydroxide ions. In a neutral solution (pH=7), the concentration of [H<sup>+</sup>] = [OH<sup>-</sup>], which means [H<sup>+</sup>] = 1\*10<sup>-7</sup> mol dm<sup>-3</sup>

1. Calculating [H<sup>+</sup>] and pH for Different Acids and Bases: 
   1 Strong Acids: 

Strong acids dissociate completely in water, so [H<sup>+</sup>] is equal to the initial acid concentration, and pH can be calculated directly from [H<sup>+</sup>]. 

1 Strong Alkalis: 

Strong alkalis are fully dissociated in water, so [OH-] is equal to the initial alkali concentration. pH can be calculated using the relation 

`                                  		   `pH = 14 - pOH

pOH = -log[OH<sup>-</sup>] 

1 Weak Acids:

Weak acids partially dissociate in water, and their dissociation constant (K<sub>a</sub>) is used to    calculate [H<sup>+</sup>] and pH.

1. Buffer Solutions: 
   1 Buffer Solution:

A buffer solution is a solution that resists changes in pH when small amounts of acids or bases are added. 

(b) Making Buffer Solutions: Buffer solutions are usually prepared by mixing a weak acid (or its conjugate base) with its conjugate base (or weak acid) in a specific ratio. 

(c) Controlling pH: Buffer solutions control pH by neutralizing the added acid or base through the reaction with their conjugate acid or base components. 

(d) Uses of Buffer Solutions: Buffer solutions are crucial in various applications, such as in biological systems (e.g., blood, which contains bicarbonate ions, HCO<sup>3-</sup>, to maintain a stable pH).

1. Calculating the pH of Buffer Solutions: The pH of a buffer solution is calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: 

pH = pK<sub>a</sub> + log([A<sup>-</sup>]/[HA]) 

where [A<sup>-</sup>] is the concentration of the conjugate base and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid.

1. Solubility Product (K<sub>sp</sub>):
   1. Solubility product (K<sub>sp</sub>) is the equilibrium constant for a sparingly soluble salt dissolving in water to form its constituent ions.
   1. For a salt, A<sub>a</sub>B<sub>b</sub>, the K<sub>sp</sub> expression is: 

K<sub>sp</sub> = [A<sup>+</sup>]<sup>a</sup>[B<sup>-</sup>]<sup>b</sup>

where [A<sup>+</sup>] is the concentration of the cation in an aqueous solution, [B<sup>-</sup>] is the concentration of the anion in an aqueous solution, and a and b are their relative concentrations.

1. Calculating K<sub>sp</sub>:
   1. From Concentrations: K<sub>sp</sub> can be calculated if the concentrations of the ions in a saturated solution of the salt are known.
   1. Vice Versa: Given K<sub>sp</sub>, the concentrations of the ions in a saturated solution can be determined.
1. Common Ion Effect: 

(a) Solubility: The presence of a common ion (an ion already present in solution) reduces the solubility of a compound in a solution. 

(b) Calculations: The common ion effect is used to calculate the solubility of a compound in the presence of a common ion, using the K<sub>sp</sub> expression and the initial concentration of the common ion.

25\.2 Partition Coefficients:

1. Partition Coefficient (K<sub>pc</sub>):
   1. The partition coefficient is a measure of how a solute distributes itself between two immiscible solvents at equilibrium.
   1. It is defined as the ratio of the concentrations (or activities) of a solute in two different phases

K<sub>pc</sub>= (concentration of solute X in solvent A)/(concentration of solute X in solvent B)

1. Factors Affecting Partition Coefficient: The numerical value of the partition coefficient depends on the polarity of the solute and the solvents used. A higher partition coefficient indicates a stronger affinity of the solute for one solvent over the other, usually based on polarity differences.
