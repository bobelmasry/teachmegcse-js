23.1 Lattice Energy and Born-Haber Cycles

-   \(a) Enthalpy change of atomization, ΔHat:

It is the enthalpy change when one mole of gaseous atoms is formed from
an element in its standard state. It represents the energy required to
break the bonds within one mole of gaseous atoms.

-   \(b) Lattice energy, ΔHlatt:

It is the enthalpy change when one mole of an ionic compound is formed
from its constituent ions in the gas phase.

First electron affinity, EA:

It is the enthalpy change when one mole of gaseous atoms accepts an
electron to form one mole of gaseous ions with a single negative charge.

\(b) Factors affecting electron affinities: The factors influencing
electron affinities include:

-   Atomic size: Smaller atoms have higher electron affinities because
     the incoming electron is closer to the nucleus, resulting in a
     stronger attractive force.

-   Nuclear charge: Higher nuclear charge increases the electron
     affinity since the attractive force between the electron and the
     nucleus is stronger.

-   Electron shielding: Increased electron shielding reduces the
     effective nuclear charge experienced by the incoming electron,
     resulting in a lower electron affinity.

\(c) Trends in electron affinities:

-   Group 16 elements (Chalcogens): The electron affinities generally
     become more negative (increasing) as you move down the group. This
     is because the atomic radius increases, and the effective nuclear
     charge experienced by the incoming electron decreases.



-   Group 17 elements (Halogens): The electron affinities become more
     negative (increasing) as you move up the group. This is because
     the atomic radius decreases, and the effective nuclear charge
     experienced by the incoming electron increases.



-   Born-Haber cycles for ionic solids: Born-Haber cycles are energy
     cycles that show the various steps involved in the formation of an
     ionic solid from its constituent elements. The steps typically
     include atomization, ionization, electron affinity, lattice
     energy, and formation of the solid.


-   Calculations involving Born-Haber cycles: Born-Haber cycles can be
     used to calculate various energy changes involved in the formation
     of ionic solids. By summing up the energy changes along a cycle,
     you can determine unknown values such as lattice energy or
     enthalpy change of formation.



-   Effect of ionic charge and radius on lattice energy:

-   Ionic charge: Higher charges on ions lead to stronger electrostatic
     attractions, resulting in higher lattice energies.

-   Ionic radius: Smaller ionic radii allow ions to come closer
     together, increasing the strength of the electrostatic attractions
     and thus increasing the lattice energy.

23.2 Enthalpies of Solution and Hydration

-   Enthalpy change of hydration, ΔHhyd:
    It is the enthalpy change when one mole of gaseous ions is dissolved in
    water to form one mole of aqueous ions.

-   Enthalpy change of solution, ΔHsol:
    It is the enthalpy change when one mole of solute is dissolved in a
    specified amount of solvent to form a solution.

-   Energy cycle involving enthalpy change of solution, lattice energy,
     and enthalpy change of hydration: This energy cycle represents the
     steps involved in the dissolution of an ionic solid. It includes
     the enthalpy change of solution, the lattice energy, and the
     enthalpy change of hydration.

-   Calculations involving energy cycles: Energy cycles can be used to
     calculate unknown values, such as enthalpy change of solution or
     enthalpy change of hydration, by summing up the energy changes
     along the cycle.

-   Effect of ionic charge and radius on enthalpy change of hydration:

-   Ionic charge: Higher charges on ions result in stronger attractions
     with water molecules, leading to more exothermic enthalpy changes
     of hydration.

-   Ionic radius: Smaller ionic radii allow ions to approach water
     molecules more closely, resulting in stronger attractions and more
     exothermic enthalpy changes of hydration.

23.3 Entropy Change, ΔS

-   Entropy, S: Entropy is a measure of the degree of randomness or
     disorder in a system. It represents the number of possible
     arrangements of particles and their energy in a given system.

-   Predicting and explaining entropy changes: (a) Change in state:
     Entropy generally increases when a substance changes from a more
     ordered state (solid) to a more disordered state (liquid or gas).
     (b) Temperature change: Entropy generally increases with an
     increase in temperature, as particles have more energy and can
     explore more arrangements. (c) Change in the number of gaseous
     molecules: Increasing the number of gaseous molecules usually
     increases entropy, as there are more possible arrangements
     of particles.

-   Calculating entropy change for a reaction, ΔS:

-              ΔS = ΣS(products) - ΣS(reactants)

-   This equation calculates the overall entropy change based on the
     standard entropies of the reactants and products.

23.4 Gibbs Free Energy Change, ΔG

-   Gibbs equation:

-                     ΔG⦵ = ΔH⦵ - TΔS⦵

-   The Gibbs equation relates the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG⦵)
     of a reaction to the standard enthalpy change (ΔH⦵), the standard
     entropy change (ΔS⦵), and Temperature.

-   Calculations using the Gibbs equation: The Gibbs equation allows the
     calculation of ΔG⦵ at a specific temperature, given the values of
     ΔH⦵ and ΔS⦵.

-   Feasibility of a reaction: If ΔG⦵ is negative, the reaction is
     thermodynamically feasible, indicating that it is spontaneous
     under standard conditions. If ΔG⦵ is positive, the reaction is
     non-spontaneous under standard conditions.

-   Effect of temperature change: Changes in temperature can affect the
     feasibility of a reaction. Increasing the temperature can make a
     non-spontaneous reaction spontaneous if the increase in
     entropy (TΔS) dominates over the increase in enthalpy (ΔH).
