## 1.1 Physical quantities
- Physical quantities consist of a numerical magnitude and a unit, they represent measurable aspects of the physical world.
- They include quantities like length, mass, time, temperature, velocity, and force.
- Each physical quantity has a specific unit of measurement associated with it.

## 1\.2 SI units: 
### 1.2.1 SI base quantities and units:

- The International System of Units (SI) is the globally recognized standard for measuring physical quantities.
- SI base quantities are the fundamental physical quantities from which all other quantities are derived.
- The SI base quantities and their units are as follows:
  - Mass (kg) measures the amount of matter in an object.
  - Length (m) measures the distance between two points.
  - Time (s) measures the duration or interval between events.
  - Electric Current (A) measures the flow of electric charge.
  - Temperature (K) measures the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance.

### 1\.2.2 Derived units:

- Derived units are obtained by combining SI base units using multiplication or division.
- Examples of derived units include:
  - Area (m²) is derived from length squared.
  - Volume (m³) is derived from length cubed.
  - Speed (m/s) is derived from distance divided by time.
  - Acceleration (m/s²) is derived from change in velocity divided by time.
- It is important to use the appropriate derived units when dealing with derived quantities.

### 1\.2.3 Prefixes:

- Prefixes are used to indicate decimal submultiples or multiples of both base and derived units.
- Commonly used SI prefixes and their symbols include:
  - Pico (p) for 10^(-12)
  - Nano (n) for 10^(-9)
  - Micro (μ) for 10^(-6)
  - Milli (m) for 10^(-3)
  - Centi "c" for 10^(-2)
  - Deci (d) for 10^(-1)
  - Kilo (k) for 10^(3)
  - Mega (M) for 10^(6)
  - Giga (G) for 10^(9)
  - Tera (T) for 10^(12)
- These prefixes help express quantities that are either very small or very large more conveniently.

## 1\.3 Errors and uncertainties:
 ### 1.3.1 Types of errors:

- Systematic errors are consistent and occur due to flaws in measurement equipment or experimental setup. They affect all measurements in the same way.
- Random errors are unpredictable and can arise from factors like human limitations, environmental conditions, or inherent variability in the measured quantity. They cause fluctuations in repeated measurements.

### 1\.3.2 Precision and accuracy:

- Precision refers to the degree of consistency or reproducibility of measurements. Precise measurements have little variation between repeated values.
- Accuracy reflects how close a measurement is to the true value. Accurate measurements have small systematic errors.

### 1\.3.3 Uncertainty in derived quantities:

- When combining measurements to calculate derived quantities, uncertainties also propagate.
- Uncertainty in a derived quantity can be estimated by adding absolute or percentage uncertainties from the measured quantities involved.

## 1\.4 Scalars and vectors:
 ### 1.4.1 Scalars:

- Scalars are quantities that have only magnitude and no direction.
- Examples of scalar quantities include mass, time, temperature, and energy.

### 1\.4.2 Vectors:

- Vectors are quantities that have both magnitude and direction.
- Examples of vector quantities include displacement, velocity, acceleration, and force.

### 1\.4.3 Vector addition and subtraction:

- Coplanar vectors (vectors lying in the same plane) can be added or subtracted by using graphical or algebraic methods.

### 1\.4.4 Vector components:

- A vector can be represented as the sum of two perpendicular components.
- The horizontal and vertical components of a vector help analyze its effects along different axes or directions.
