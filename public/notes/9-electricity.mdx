## 9.1 Electric current:

- Electric current is the flow of charge carriers (usually electrons) in a circuit.
- Charge carriers have quantized charges, meaning they carry charges in discrete units.
- The equation **Q = It** relates charge (Q) to current (I) and time (t).
- For a current-carrying conductor, the equation **I = Anvq** can be used, where A is the cross-sectional area, n is the number density of charge carriers, v is the drift velocity, and q is the charge of each carrier.

## 9.2 Potential difference and power:

- Potential difference (voltage) across a component is the energy transferred per unit charge.
- The equation **V = W/Q** relates potential difference (V) to work done (W) and charge (Q).
- Power (P) is the rate at which energy is transferred or transformed.
- Power can be calculated using the equations **P = VI**, **P = I<sup>2</sup>R**, and **P = V<sup>2</sup>/R**.

## 9.3 Resistance and resistivity:

- Resistance "R" is a measure of how a component or material opposes the flow of electric current.
- Ohm's law states that the current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference across it, provided the temperature and other factors remain constant.
- The equation **V = IR** relates potential difference (V), current (I), and resistance "R".
- The I-V characteristics of different components can be observed, such as a metallic conductor (constant temperature), a semiconductor diode, and a filament lamp.
- The resistance of a filament lamp increases as current increases due to the increase in temperature.
- The resistance of a component can be determined by the equation **R = ρL/A**, where ρ is the resistivity, L is the length of the component, and A is the cross-sectional area.
- The resistance of a light-dependent resistor (LDR) decreases as light intensity increases.
- The resistance of a thermistor decreases as temperature increases (assuming a negative temperature coefficient).
